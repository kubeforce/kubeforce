                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources
                        like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful
                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important.

                  faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like
                  service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally
                  wrong with the Agent's spec or the configuration of the controller,
                  and that manual intervention is required."
